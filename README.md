This boilerplate project was implemented in order to create a code base for the Playwright framework and to demonstrate functionality provided by the framework, as well as to investigate possibilities of integrating TypeScript programming language and Playwright automation framework with GitHub actions.

Also during the process of working on this project the following goals were set:
- [x] Using self-hosted runners to run GH Actions
- [x] Using localhost deployment for testing purposes without binding to a remote domain
- [x] Use of docker images to isolate the testing environment from the self-hosted runner
- [x] Using docker-compose to optimize self-hosted runner resource consumption and speed up GH Actions execution time
- [ ] Create an NPM library based on page object files for investigation purposes as well as to address scaling issues of the project using the methods of this project for other repositories
